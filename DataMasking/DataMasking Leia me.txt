This code can be executed in any sql server 2016 and newer version.
The table and data populated are inside the code.
There's also one user created for this purpose with the permissions
needed for test.

There are four types of DataMasking, Default(),Email(),Partial(n,"***",n) and Random(n,n)
each one with a different purpose. This .sql file uses all of them to show
how to use them and what they do.

The tables are selected using the master user and also the created for this
purpose user, to show how the data behave when using them in the scope.
 
There's also one update executed by the created user. This user doesnt have
permission for viewing the data but it has permission for updating.

Theres also one example of dropping a masked column.
